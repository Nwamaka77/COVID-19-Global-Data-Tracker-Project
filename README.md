# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to provide insights into the pandemic's impact across different countries and regions. The analysis includes visualizations of case numbers, death rates, recovery rates, and regional comparisons to help understand the global situation and identify patterns and outliers.
Objectives

Analyze and visualize global COVID-19 case distribution across countries
Compare death rates and recovery rates between different regions and countries
Identify countries with rapid case growth and concerning health indicators
Examine the relationship between active and recovered cases
Provide a comprehensive overview of the global pandemic situation

## Tools and Libraries Used

Python 3.13.2: Primary programming language
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment
Visual Studio Code: Integrated development environment
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical operations and calculations
Matplotlib: Data visualization and charting
Seaborn: Enhanced statistical visualizations

### How to Run the Project

This project was developed using Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code.

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6+)
Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Install VS Code and the Python extension
Download the dataset file: country_wise_latest.csv
Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in VS Code
Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook
Run the notebook cells sequentially using the run button (▶️) next to each cell or use Shift+Enter

## Dataset
The project uses the country_wise_latest.csv dataset, which contains country-level COVID-19 statistics including:

Confirmed cases
Deaths
Recovered cases
Active cases
New cases and deaths
Case growth rates
Recovery and death rates
WHO region classification

## Key Insights

--- Key Insights and Findings ---

1. Global Situation Overview:
• Total confirmed cases worldwide: 16,480,485
• Total deaths worldwide: 654,036
• Global death rate: 3.97%
• Global recovery rate: 57.45%
• Currently active cases: 6,358,362 (38.58% of total cases)

2. Regional Analysis:
• America has the highest number of confirmed cases with 8,839,286 cases
• Europe has the highest death rate at 6.40%

3. Country-level Analysis:
• The US has the highest number of confirmed cases: 4,290,259
• The US has reported the most deaths: 148,011
• Among countries with 1000+ cases, Yemen has the highest death rate: 28.56%
• Djibouti shows the highest recovery rate at 98.38%
• Zimbabwe has the fastest weekly growth rate at 57.85%

4. Comparative Analysis:
• The top 10 countries account for 76.73% of all active cases worldwide
• 17 countries/regions have reported zero deaths
• 36 countries are experiencing rapid growth (>20% weekly increase)

5. Recovery Analysis:
• 96 countries show strong recovery rates (>70%)
• 23 countries show concerning low recovery rates (<30%)


6. Potential Improvements

Incorporate time-series analysis to track pandemic progression
Add demographic data to analyze the impact across different population segments
Include vaccination data once widely available
Implement interactive visualizations for easier exploration

7. Limitations

Data quality depends on reporting accuracy from different countries
Testing practices and case definitions vary across regions
Some regions may have significant underreporting of cases or deaths
The dataset provides a snapshot at a specific point in time and needs regular updating

## --- Conclusion ---

This analysis provides a snapshot of the global COVID-19 situation based on the dataset provided. 
Key observations include:

1. The pandemic's impact varies significantly by region and country, with some areas experiencing
   much higher case loads, deaths, and growth rates than others.

2. While some countries show promising recovery rates, others continue to struggle with 
   containing active cases and improving outcomes.

3. The weekly growth rate indicates where the pandemic is accelerating, highlighting areas
   that may need additional attention and resources.

4. Regional differences in death and recovery rates might indicate variations in healthcare
   capacity, reporting methodologies, or effectiveness of public health measures.

5. The concentration of active cases in a relatively small number of countries suggests that
   targeted international support could have a significant impact on the global situation.
